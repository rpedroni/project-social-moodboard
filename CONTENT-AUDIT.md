# 📋 Content Audit — Non-Tech Audience Pivot

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Trigger:** Ricardo's clarification in #posts — target audience is NON-TECH. People who use or want to use AI, but don't code. Potential product users, not developers.

## The Filter

✅ **KEEP** = Accessible to someone who's never opened a terminal
⚠️ **REWORK** = Good core idea, but needs non-tech reframing
❌ **REPLACE** = Too dev-specific, no salvage for non-tech audience

---

## Week 1 (Feb 9–15)

| Post | Verdict | Issue |
|------|---------|-------|
| Hot Take #001 — "IA pra e-mail de 3 linhas" | ✅ KEEP | Universal. Everyone writes emails. |
| IA do Dia #001 — Cursor | ❌ REPLACE | Code editor. Caption literally says "se não programa, pula pro próximo post 😄". |
| Lição #001 — "IA vai roubar seu emprego" | ✅ KEEP | Universal topic, accessible language. |
| Hot Take #002 — "Devs -17% com IA passiva" | ⚠️ REWORK | Good insight (passive AI use = atrophy) but framed 100% for devs. Generalize to any professional. |
| IA do Dia #002 — Perplexity | ✅ KEEP | "Imagina se o Google entendesse sua pergunta" — perfect for non-tech. |
| Lição #002 — "Usar IA sem pensar" | ⚠️ REWORK | Core idea is universal but leans on dev examples (copiar código). Needs non-dev analogies. |
| Hot Take #003 — "Cursos de prompt = R$2k" | ✅ KEEP | Non-tech friendly. Many normies are considering these courses. |

### Week 1 Score: 3 ✅, 2 ⚠️, 1 ❌ (1 replacement needed before Monday!)

---

## Week 2 (Feb 16–22)

| Post | Verdict | Issue |
|------|---------|-------|
| Hot Take #004 — "Seniors ganham 5x mais" | ⚠️ REWORK | Good concept (expertise amplified by AI) but all dev examples (CRUD, rate limiting). |
| IA do Dia #003 — ElevenLabs | ✅ KEEP | Voice cloning — cool and accessible to everyone. |
| Hot Take #006 — "95% IA são wrappers" | ⚠️ REWORK | "Wrapper" is a dev term. The insight (most AI tools just resell ChatGPT) is great for everyone. |
| Lição #004 — Alucinação | ✅ KEEP | Universal. Everyone needs to know AI lies confidently. |
| IA do Dia #005 — v0 | ⚠️ REWORK | v0 generates websites — could reframe as "crie sites sem programar" which IS non-tech friendly. |
| Hot Take #007 — Prompt Engineering RIP | ✅ KEEP | Directly relevant to non-tech people being sold courses. |
| IA do Dia #004 — NotebookLM | ✅ KEEP | Turns documents into podcasts — very non-tech friendly. |

### Week 2 Score: 4 ✅, 3 ⚠️, 0 ❌

---

## Week 3 (Feb 23–Mar 1)

| Post | Verdict | Issue |
|------|---------|-------|
| Hot Take #008 — "Investimentos em IA falhando" | ✅ KEEP | Business/macro insight, accessible. |
| IA do Dia #006 — Windsurf | ❌ REPLACE | IDE/code editor. Ricardo literally said "comparar VS Code com Cursor não significa muito". |
| Lição #006 — Context windows | ✅ KEEP | Ricardo confirmed this is "alto nível o suficiente". |
| Hot Take #005 — Family offices + crypto | ✅ KEEP | Finance topic, accessible. |
| Hot Take #009 — "1B vídeos IA" | ✅ KEEP | Content/authenticity — very accessible. |
| Lição #003 — Prompts genéricos | ⚠️ REWORK | Core idea is great but example uses TypeScript/Hono/SQLite. Needs non-dev examples. |
| Lição #005 — FOMO de ferramentas | ⚠️ REWORK | Lists Copilot, Cursor, v0 — could simplify to "pick 1 and go deep". |

### Week 3 Score: 4 ✅, 2 ⚠️, 1 ❌

## Summary

| | ✅ Keep | ⚠️ Rework | ❌ Replace |
|--|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Week 1 | 3 | 2 | **1** (Cursor) |
| Week 2 | 4 | 3 | 0 |
| Week 3 | 4 | 2 | **1** (Windsurf) |
| **Total** | **11** | **7** | **2** |

## 🚨 Priority: 2 Replacements Needed

### Replace IA do Dia #001 (Cursor) with something non-tech
**Suggestions:**
1. **ChatGPT** — The one everyone already uses. Tips on how to use it better.
2. **Canva AI** — Designers and normies use it daily. Magic Design, text-to-image.
3. **Gamma** — AI that makes presentations. Everyone makes presentations.
4. **Kling/Runway** — AI video generation. Wow factor.

### Replace IA do Dia #006 (Windsurf) with something non-tech
**Suggestions:**
1. **Suno** — AI music creation. Super viral.
2. **Midjourney/DALL-E** — AI image generation. Visual, shareable.
3. **Descript** — Edit video by editing text. Content creators love it.
4. **Otter.ai** — AI meeting notes. Universal for professionals.

## ⚠️ Rework Queue (7 posts)
Each needs non-dev analogies and examples. Core insights stay, framing changes:
- Hot Take #002: "passive AI = atrophy" → generalize beyond devs
- Lição #002: "using AI without thinking" → use non-code examples
- Hot Take #004: "expertise × AI" → professionals, not just seniors devs
- Hot Take #006: "wrappers" → "most AI tools just resell ChatGPT with a pretty interface"
- IA do Dia #005: v0 → reframe as "create websites without coding" (actually non-tech!)
- Lição #003: "generic prompts" → use everyday examples (planning a trip, writing a resume)
- Lição #005: "tool FOMO" → simplify tool list to non-dev ones
