# 🎠 Carousel Upgrade Plan — Week 2+

## Why (Feb 2026 Data)

**Static single images are leaving reach on the table.**

| Metric | Static Image | Carousel (with music) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| Engagement rate | 0.24% avg | 0.55% avg | **+129%** |
| Reach multiplier | 1x | 1.8x | **+80%** |
| Likes + Comments + Saves | baseline | **+114%** | SocialBu, 2026 |
| Views counted | 1 view/person | 1 view/slide/person | **3x+ views** |

Sources: CreatorFlow (Jan 2026), SocialBu (Feb 2026), Ned Potter (2025 data), DIY Photography (Feb 2026)

### Key Finding
> "I wouldn't post any individual images this year — why throttle your own reach when a Carousel would go so much further?"
> — Ned Potter, UoY Library (201% YoY views increase using carousels)

**Critical detail: Adding MUSIC to carousels pushes them into Reels algorithm = much wider distribution.**

## How to Convert Each Format

### 🔥 Hot Take → 3-Slide Carousel

**Current:** 1 static image with full text
**Upgrade:** 3 slides that create tension → insight → call to action

| Slide | Content | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 — Hook | Bold claim only. "Se você precisa de IA pra escrever um e-mail de 3 linhas…" | Stop the scroll |
| 2 — Punch | The actual take. "…o problema não é produtividade. É clareza de pensamento." | Deliver value |
| 3 — CTA | "Concorda? Salva e manda pra alguém que precisa ouvir isso 🔥" + @rpedroni | Drive Sends (key metric) |

**Why it works:** Each swipe = algorithm signal. The cliffhanger between slides 1 and 2 forces swipes. Slide 3 explicitly asks for Sends (Instagram's #1 ranking signal in 2026).

### 🤖 IA do Dia → 4-Slide Carousel

| Slide | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1 — Hook | Tool logo + "Você tá usando [tool] errado" or "Se você não conhece [tool]…" |
| 2 — What | What it does (1-2 sentences + visual) |
| 3 — How | Concrete use case / screenshot |
| 4 — Verdict + CTA | Score/recommendation + "Salva pra testar depois" |

### 📚 Lição de IA → 5-Slide Carousel

| Slide | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1 — Hook | Myth statement: "IA vai roubar seu emprego" |
| 2 — Data | Counter-evidence (stat, study) |
| 3 — Reality | What's actually happening |
| 4 — Takeaway | Actionable insight |
| 5 — CTA | "Manda pra quem tá com medo 😂" |

## Music Strategy

**Must add background music to every carousel.** This triggers the Reels algorithm.

Recommended: Instrumental/lo-fi beats (won't distract from reading). Browse Instagram's music library for:
- Trending lo-fi
- Trending instrumental
- Any currently viral sound (piggyback on trend)

**Length:** Match to ~15-30 seconds expected swipe time.

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1 (Feb 9-15) — Launch as planned
- Static images are FINE for Week 1
- Purpose is to establish presence, not optimize
- Collect baseline metrics to compare later

### Week 2 (Feb 16-22) — Carousel conversion
- Convert Hot Take #004, #005 to carousel format
- A/B test: keep one static post to compare reach
- Add music to all carousels
- Track: reach, saves, sends per carousel vs static

### Week 3+ — Full carousel mode
- All new content as carousels
- Minimum 3 slides, max 10
- Each slide stands alone (users skip slides)
- Always end with explicit CTA for Sends

---

## Quick Template Structure

Each carousel slide uses the same visual frame (dark bg, @rpedroni branding) but:
- **Slide 1:** Larger text, bolder color accent, no @handle (let the hook breathe)
- **Middle slides:** Normal layout, supporting text/data/visuals
- **Last slide:** CTA with @rpedroni, bright accent color, action verb

This maintains brand consistency while optimizing for the carousel format.

---

## Bottom Line

Week 1 = ship what we have (static). Week 2 = upgrade to carousels.
Expected impact: **~2x reach, ~2x engagement** based on Feb 2026 data.
The only cost is spending 20 extra minutes splitting content into slides.
